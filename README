libsnmp
=======

This project is my dirty playground to learn more about the SNMP protocol and to
toy with techniques and advices highlighted in 'Effective Java', by Joshua Bloch.

As such, I don't believe it to be even near production quality but can of course
be forked and made to evolve to become more robust and grow the required
features one would expect from a good SNMP library.
